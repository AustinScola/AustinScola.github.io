# Blog Principles

I think it is important to articulate purpose of something. Then based on that purpose, continuously
craft operating principles to guide the policy for selecting actions which optimize for that
purpose (but always beware of [Goodhart's Law][1]).

Here are some initial principles for this webiste, I will revise them over time:

## Make the bake level clear 

Make it clear how baked a thought is. In other words, make it clear how much thought, research,
validation, et cererae have gone into shared information.

## Post _somewhat_ regularly

Post somewhat regularly. The value of the information set is not linear with either the frequency
of sharing or the amount of shared information.

## Bites, meals, and festivals

Share information in different chunk sizes for satiating different sized appetites.
