# Blog Principles

I think it is important to articulate purpose of something. Then based on that purpose, continuously
craft operating principles to guide the policy for selecting actions which optimize for that
purpose (but always beware of [Goodhart's Law][1]).

Here are some initial principles for this webiste, I will revise them over time:

## Make the bake level clear 

Make it clear how baked a thought is. If I have thought about it for a long time and strongly
believe it, then make that clear. If it just a passing thought that is not researched make that
clear (and maybe don't share half-baked thoughts). If I am simply wondering about something make
that clear too. If I have heavily researched something than make that clear. Don't come across as an
expert when you are a noob. Don't act noobish when you know what's up.

## Post _somewhat_ regularly

Post somewhat regularly. The value of the information set is not linear with the amount posted and
also depends on the frequency.
