title:  "Hello, friend."

So this is my first blog post. I have a few reservations about this endeavour:
- Is blogging egotistical?
- I think I would prefer a more live depiction and organization of my public thoughts. Ideally one
that could also be used to organize private thoughts too.
- If I would prefer a different system for thought organization then this blog potentially adds a
switching cost.
- Someone will be able to train an NN to imitate me with all this data...

Despite these reservations I have some hypothesis that I would like to test:
- Blogging will make me a better writer and person.
- I have things to share that others might find interesting?
- I will enjoy it.
- It can be beneficial to others.

That last one is key. So hello friend, I hope this benefits you. Maybe you learn something new,
maybe you think everything I say is wrong and you get a good laugh! Or maybe you have something to
teach me, and maybe we really do become friends.
