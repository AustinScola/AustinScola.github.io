title:  "Hello, friend."

So this is my first blog post. And, I have a few reservations about this endeavour:
- I have yet to determine if I think blogging is egotistical?
- I think I would prefer a more _live_ depiction and organization of my public thoughts. (Ideally,
a tool that could be used for organizing private thoughts too.)
- Because I would prefer a different system for thought organization, then this blog potentially
adds a switching cost.
- Someone will be able to train an NN to imitate me with all this data...

Despite these reservations, I have some hypothesis that I would like to test:
- It will be beneficial for myself.
    - Blogging will make me a better writer and a better person.
    - I will enjoy it.
    - I will better learn the information that I share.
- It can be beneficial to others.
    - I have things to share that others might find interesting.
    - I have things to teach others
    - I have things to entertain others.

So hello friend, I hope this benefits you. And I hope this blog benefits me too. And if it doesn't
do either of those, then maybe it does some yet unforseen ternary option. Here's to finding out; to
testing hypotheses!
